# MyHort Android APP
**Brief desc** :
This app is made to fulfill my Final Project in order to graduate from AKN Putra Sang Fajar (yay!). The app's name is MyHort and it is used to monitor a garden that already has an IoT tool. 

**How it works** :
the app is basically used to get/show and/or change the values in a database through an API that I also created using Laravel. Check it out here https://github.com/Lokacodes/MyHort-LaravelAPI.git
